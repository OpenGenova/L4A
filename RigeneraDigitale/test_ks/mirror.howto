lighttpd:
dir-listing.activate      = "enable"

mirror:
use a mirror realized by apt-mirror, i used it.archive.ubuntu.com.

Using an usb disk with a root directory called /ubuntu/ the following tree should be created, by apt-mirror:
mirror/  skel/  var/

Note that for some reasosn i had to add explicitally also in my mirror.list
deb http://it.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial main/debian-installer restricted/debian-installer

Restricted debian-installer is missing and Ubuntu 16.04 mini iso fails to install.

At this point you can mount (change sdX1 with your disk):
mount /dev/sdX1 /var/www/html/mirrors

installer:
host mirror IP (for instance 192.168.1.1)
path:
/mirrors/ubuntu/mirror/it.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/
first "/" is important

if ks has the following line:
preseed mirror/http/directory string /ubuntu/
that means that we need a link to ubuntu as below:
cd /var/www/html
ln -s mirrors/ubuntu/mirror/it.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu ubuntu
