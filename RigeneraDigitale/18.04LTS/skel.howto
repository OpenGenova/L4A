user skelethon is needed to add new user (as well as the default one) with the same configuration.
The kickstart file (preseed) needs to download a tarball of skel directory from mirror.opengenova.org,
to simplify that.

To release this file do the following comands:
cd skel
tar ../skel.tar.bz2 .
and then upload it to mirror.opengenova.it.
